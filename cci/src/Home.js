                <p>It started with one woman reaching out to 10 children. Moved with compassion for children of leprosy patients, Mrs Lily Prabhakar, the wife of an IAS officer, started the orphanage in 1970 in a rented house in Chennai. Very soon she realized she needed to integrate these children with others so that they do not carry the stigma of 'children of leprosy patients'. She then started to take in other children as well; the Home now reaches out to orphans as well as destitute children of struggling single parents, especially those parents in poor health. Kudos to the team of housewives who worked alongside Mrs Prabhakar, when the odds were against them. Undaunted by the extremely limited finances, this dedicated team were determined and daring, giving their all for these hopeless children.</p>
                <p>The Tamil Nadu State Government gifted land to the Home in Maduravoyal, on the outskirts of Chennai, and the main building was constructed in 1974. In 1995, the Tanya Nursery and Primary School was started on the premises of the Home. Here the children receive primary education, after which they are sent to local schools to continue their studies. A clinic and medical dispensary in a separate building on the campus were added in 1999.</p>
                <p>In 2010 we started the process of re-constructing a new building for the children to meet the growing needs. As of February 2013, we have moved the children into this new facility, made possible by the generous donations of kind sponsors. Today, it is a new Home with a renewed passion to pursue the founding vision and achieve the many goals ahead of us.</p>
                <p>Our grateful thanks to the untiring efforts of all the sponsors who have so generously supported the Home from the very inception. May God bless each one of you.</p>
                <p>We look forward to new visionaries to take each child to their destined destination. The sky is the limit as the children are encouraged to dream, to breakthrough into unchartered areas.</p>
